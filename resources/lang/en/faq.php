    ['q'=>'Do I need to know the basics?', 'a'=>'No. There are groups from zero and for beginners. We start with short sentences and practise speaking right away.'],
    ['q'=>'What do online lessons look like?', 'a'=>'We meet on Zoom/Google Meet. We work with shared materials, do role-plays and short practical exercises.'],
    ['q'=>'How many people are in a group?', 'a'=>'Usually 2–5 people, so everyone speaks a lot and gets feedback.'],
    ['q'=>'Will I get materials?', 'a'=>'Yes. Materials + a short post-lesson summary, vocabulary in sentences and a 10-minute mini task.'],
    ['q'=>'Can I change the group if the level isn’t right?', 'a'=>'Yes. After 1–2 meetings we can adjust the group so the pace feels perfect.'],
    ['q'=>'Are lessons available in Polish, English and Italian?', 'a'=>'Yes. The website is in PL/EN/IT and we adapt the support language to your level during class.'],
