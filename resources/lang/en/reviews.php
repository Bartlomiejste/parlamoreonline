Highly recommended!',

      'text' => 'Perfect! One hundred percent — don’t wait!! Aleksandra is an excellent teacher of both Polish and Italian. I challenged her to help me improve my Polish while also teaching me a new language — Italian — and she handled it brilliantly. Her fluency and teaching skills in both languages are truly impressive. For Polish, she uses a variety of materials, from audio recordings to articles, making learning engaging and demanding. For Italian, we work more traditionally with a textbook to build strong foundations. She is also very flexible with scheduling, communicates excellently, and truly understands my needs and goals. I wholeheartedly recommend learning one or both languages with her. I also mentioned that I often lose paper notes, and she was very understanding and suggested keeping a “live” Word document that we update continuously with new materials.',
